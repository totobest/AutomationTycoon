Version: 0.9.0
  Features:
    - You cannot build neither belts outside as they are not waterproof (duh).
    You can only build them in Factorissimo2 buildings.
    - A Factorissimo2 level 0 is now available when starting a game.
    - Cities spawn in the map randomly. Providing what they need gives you cash in return.
    - [TechnologyMarket] Spend your cash to research new technologies. Labs now accepts ucoin.
    - As there is no more belts outside, mining-drills are not easy to automate at low-tech. You might have to
     use AAI miners instead.

      - Use AAI Hauler to transport items between buildings.
      - Use Train to transport items between buildings.
