Version: 0.9.0
  Features:
    - You cannot build neither belts nor inserters outside as they are not waterproof (duh).
    You can only build them in Factorissimo2 buildings.
    - Big Factories/Furnaces spawn in the map randomly. Providing what they need gives you cash in return.
    - [TechnologyMarket] Spend your cash to research new technologies. Labs now accepts ucoin.
    - [BlackMarket2] You can sell/buy items/fluids/energy through the Black Market
    - [BlackMarket2] Loans can be taken out by a player. Loan interest is paid monthly to the bank,
    at the current interest rate. The initial interest rate is set at the game start
    according to the difficulty settings. The interest rate does not change during the game.
    - Be-aware of bankruptcy, rogues are not nice with people who does not pay.
    - As there is no more belts outside, mining-drills are not usable anymore, thus they are disabled.
    You have to use AAI miners or Mining Robots.
    - Get better at Multimodal transport or combined transport:
      - Use AAI Hauler to transport items between buildings.
        - TIPS : Cars run faster on road
      - Use Train to transport items between buildings.
      - Use Air to transport items between buildings. (v1.0.0)
    - Fluid -> You need to use barrels (maybe later, hauler for fluids?)
    - Of course, native are not going to help you in the task.
    - Big Factories/Furnaces might change their needs randomly. The growth of
    the output of primary industries depends upon the percentage of cargo
    transported away from them. The more you transport, the faster it grows in
    the long term on average.


  Changes:
    None

Property Maintenance
Why did I build so many signals?
The expense of property maintenance is directly proportional to the company's
number of rail and road pieces, canals, and station/airport tiles. You can see
the cost for each type of infrastructure from the Company window.
