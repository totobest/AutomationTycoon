# Automation Tycoon
A mod for the game Factorio

## Short description
Brings concepts of a famous Tycoon game into Factorio.


## Long description

You've found out that your belts are not waterproof and cannot be built
outside of buildings.
You have to use your engineering skills to connect your factory buildings
together. Through, technology, you will start transporting your items using
Haulers, trains, robots, cargo ships and cargo planes. Multimodal transport yeah !

For researching technologies, you have to deal with an ancient passive
civilization who has established cities on the planet.
They are energy spirits only so they cannot gather resource for themselves.
Provide what they need, and they
will give you some ucoins (the planet currency) in exchange.
Spend ucoins to unlock technologies.

You can't miss the Ancient' cities as they look like big assembling
machines, duh.

## Get started

Don't try this mod in an save game. You will get frustrated.
Better to start with a new game!
Rethink how to build a factory without belts.

IMPORTANT :
In Factorissimo2 settings, disable Factorissimo2 recursion tech and
set the research to easy.

## Settings

If you feel you miss your belts, you can re-enable them in the settings.


## Know bugs

- Map generation settings does not work for cities placement yet.
